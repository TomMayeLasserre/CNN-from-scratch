# CNN from Scratch

## Description

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It includes the core CNN implementation, a Jupyter Notebook explaining the mathematical foundations, and another notebook for training and testing the model.

## Project Structure

- `CNN.py`: Contains the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network model.
- `CNN_maths_explenation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the mathematical foundations of CNNs, including convolution, pooling, and backpropagation.
- `CNN_train_test.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the CNN on a dataset.
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store datasets used for training and testing.

## Features

- **Custom CNN implementation**: Written from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Mathematical explanations**: Includes a detailed mathematical explanation of CNN operations, including convolution and backpropagation.
- **Training and Testing**: Includes a notebook for training the CNN on custom datasets and evaluating the performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-from-scratch.git
